# draughts

#### TODO:

+ null for forbidden tiles (instead of drawing graphic)?, but tile must draw itself...
+ animate color change, a little surplus in color saturation and then back to final color
+ unselect men when clicked on empty tile
+ disable highlight after completing move (in onComplete?)
+ ~~place where another white man stands is not considered as not allowed -> update tile.man~~
+ draw objects with gradient
+ unhover objects when mouse leaves canvas
+
